# Edge Gateway Framework

An edge AI security gateway that runs real-time person detection on a USB camera using the RK3588 NPU, automatically records video clips when a person is in frame, and uploads them to AWS S3 — all while providing local Wi-Fi based device provisioning through a captive-portal style web UI.

## Overview

Edge Gateway Framework is a self-contained edge computing device (built on an Orange Pi 5 Max) that combines:

- On-device computer vision (YOLOv8 person detection via the RK3588 NPU)
- Automated event-based video recording and cloud upload
- A local hotspot + captive portal for zero-internet device configuration
- A dual-implementation backend (Python and C++) with a benchmark suite comparing the two
- OTA-style versioned deployment structure

The project was built as a hands-on deep dive into embedded Linux, edge AI inference, systems programming, and full-stack device management — going from bare hardware bring-up to a working, remotely configurable AI appliance.

## Key Features

- **Real-time person detection**: YOLOv8n model converted to `.rknn` format, running inference on the RK3588's NPU via `rknn-toolkit-lite2`.
- **Event-driven recording**: Recording starts the moment a person enters the camera frame and stops after a configurable grace period once they leave.
- **Automatic cloud upload**: Completed recordings are uploaded to an S3 bucket using `boto3`, with credentials managed via a `.env` file (excluded from version control).
- **Zero-internet provisioning**: The device broadcasts its own Wi-Fi hotspot (`hostapd` + `dnsmasq`) so it can be configured from a phone or laptop with no internet connection required.
- **Captive portal handling**: Custom `nginx` rules redirect Android/iOS/Windows captive-portal probes to the device's configuration page, with a fallback for browsers whose WebView blocks JavaScript `fetch` calls.
- **Dual backend implementation**: The core session pipeline (API server, config manager, database, session/recording pipeline) is implemented in both Python and C++, allowing direct performance comparison.
- **Benchmark suite**: `benchmark.py` and `benchmark.cpp` measure and compare pipeline performance across both implementations.
- **Lightweight web dashboard**: A vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend served via `nginx`, showing live device status (hostname, IP, config state, camera connection) and allowing configuration changes.
- **Versioned OTA-style deployments**: Release archives (`v1.0.0.zip`, `v1.0.1.zip`) and a `current/` symlinked directory structure support safe, rollback-friendly updates.

## How It Works

1. **Provisioning**: On first boot, the device broadcasts a Wi-Fi hotspot. Connecting to it triggers a captive portal (or manual browser visit to `http://192.168.4.1`) that loads the configuration dashboard.
2. **Configuration**: Users set the device name, mode, Wi-Fi credentials, and provisioning options through the web form, which POSTs to `/api/config`.
3. **Detection loop**: Once configured, the camera pipeline continuously captures frames, runs them through the YOLOv8n model on the NPU, and checks for a person (COCO class 0) above a confidence threshold.
4. **Recording**: The moment a person is detected, recording starts. Recording continues until the person has been absent for a defined grace period (e.g. 3 seconds), then the clip is finalized.
5. **Upload**: Finalized clips are uploaded asynchronously to an S3 bucket via a background thread, keeping the detection loop uninterrupted.
6. **Monitoring**: The `/api/status` endpoint reports live device health (online status, hostname, IP, config state, camera connection, pipeline running state) to the dashboard, polled every few seconds.

## Notable Engineering Challenges Solved

- **Static asset misrouting**: Diagnosed and fixed an nginx configuration issue where CSS/JS requests were falling through to `index.html` due to a missing dedicated `/static/` location block.
- **Captive portal WebView fetch blocking**: Identified that Android's system WebView (used for captive portal popups) silently blocks `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest` calls, causing the dashboard to appear stuck on "Loading...". Solved with OS-specific captive-portal probe redirects (Android `generate_204`, Apple `hotspot-detect.html`, Windows `connecttest.txt`/`ncsi.txt`) that push users into the full Chrome browser, plus a timeout-based fetch fallback in the frontend.
- **Cross-language pipeline parity**: Maintained functionally equivalent session pipelines in both Python and C++ to benchmark real-world performance differences for the same NPU-driven workload.
- **Safe OTA structure**: Adopted a versioned `current/` + archived `downloads/` layout to support rollback-friendly updates without breaking an active deployment.

## Setup (High-Level)

> Full step-by-step hardware and software setup instructions are maintained separately due to length.

1. Flash Orange Pi 5 Max with a supported Linux image.
2. Install Python 3.10 (required for `rknn-toolkit-lite2` compatibility) via `altinstall`, alongside the system Python.
3. Install the RKNN NPU runtime (`librknnrt.so`) and the `rknn-toolkit-lite2` Python wheel matching your Python/ABI version.
4. Install OpenCV (headless), NumPy, boto3, and python-dotenv in a dedicated virtual environment.
5. Connect and verify the USB camera (`/dev/video0`).
6. Download or convert a YOLOv8n `.rknn` model (pre-converted models available via Rockchip's `rknn-model-zoo`).
7. Configure `hostapd`, `dnsmasq`, and `nginx` for hotspot provisioning and captive portal handling.
8. Set AWS credentials in a local `.env` file (never committed to git).
9. Build the C++ backend with CMake, or run the Python backend directly.
10. Start the gateway using `scripts/start-gateway.sh`.

## Security Notes

- AWS credentials are loaded from an untracked `.env` file and must never be committed to version control.
- Rotate AWS keys immediately if they were ever exposed during development.
- The device's Wi-Fi hotspot is intended for local provisioning only and does not provide internet passthrough by design.

---

## Roadmap / Future Work

- Captive portal auto-popup refinement across more device/OS combinations
- Optional internet passthrough mode
- Expanded AI capabilities (multi-class detection, face recognition modes)
- Formal versioned release automation via `updater.py`
